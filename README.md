#### Lesson Summary:

This lesson introduces the what and why of APIs followed by introductory examples of how to write some simple API requests using the requests package.

#### Topic:

API Requests

#### Learn.co material:

* [HTTP Request/Response Cycle - Codealong](https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/dsc-http-request-response-codealong)
* [Yelp API - Codealong](https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/dsc-using-yelp-api-codealong)

#### Prerequisite knowledge/ Prework:

Lists and dictionaries.

#### Learning goals for this lesson:

• Navigate a JSON file
• Make API get requests
• Write Get request headers
• Parse an http response

#### Key Takeaways

* HTTP get requests will respond with an object that contains a status code AND content
* The content you are interested in will be stored under the `.json()`	method of the object.
* You can also send data to a HTTP endpoint with a post request
* JSON files are nested data structures similar to nested dictionaries and lists
* Be careful about API rate limits when making requests

#### Misconceptions / Notes


#### Materials
- Ipython notebook

#### Vocab / Concepts 

* HTTP Requests
* HTTP Status Codes: 200, 400, 404
* HTTP Get / Post Requests
* API
* Headers

#### Lesson Outline:

* Why APIs (3min)
* Parts of an API (3min)
* Types of APIs (10 minutes)
* HTTP Requests
	* Get requests (8 minutes)
	* Post Requests (5 minutes)
	* OAuth (5 minutes) 
* **Example API** (10-15 minutes)
	This should be used as an informal assessmentt to check for student understanding: Choose an api, pull up documentation and have students guide how to code the request in Python

#### To Do / Steps For Improvement

* Checks for Understanding
* Student Practice Questions
